## Why do version control

- Revert to previous version
- Keep record of who made what changes when
- Transparency

## How to do version control

- [Edit, Save, Attach](http://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#what-is-the-payoff)
- Consistent file-naming (and incrementing) conventions
    + gilmore-etal-nature-2017-01-28-1319.docx
    + gilmore-etal-nature-2017-01-28-1400.docx
    + ... etc.
    
## Pros and cons

- Pros
    + No special software needed
    + Works with every file type
    + Good for any file type
- Cons
    + Not everyone uses the same file naming conventions
    + Dealing with conflicts
    + File management

## How to do version control

- Google Docs
    + Gilmore, Diaz, Wyble, & Yarkoni (in press). Progress Toward Openness, Transparency, and Reproducibility in Cognitive Neuroscience. *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*. <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOL_AdvMceJluyPsL9aop1iBqxOla15fXcstPFHe9e0/edit?usp=sharing>

## Pros and cons

- Pros
    + Works with docs and sheets
    + Unlimited, automatic track changes
    + Stored in cloud
    + No special naming conventions
- Cons
    + NYAS Editor wanted Word doc with track changes!
    + Not all types of files
    + Not everyone likes/knows how to use Google docs
    
## How to do version control

- Box.com
    + Enterprise version stores 100 versions

</div>

## Pros and cons

- Pros
    + Keep the same file name
    + Let Box do automatic versioning
    + Shared file space
    + Any kind of file Box supports
- Cons
    + 100 versions
    + Penn State enterprise license
    
## How to do version control

- [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/)
- Pros
    + Multiple platforms (like Box)
    + Multiple file types
    + HT: Hallquist lab uses for non-code
- Cons
    + ?

## How to do version control

- [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io)
    + Integrates with Box, Dropbox, GitHub
- Pros
    + Free, open source, devoted to open science
    + Many different file types
- Cons
    + Version control depends on storage sources
    + Wyble lab reports [some frustrations](https://psu-psychology.github.io/data-science-and-reproducibility/forum.html?place=msg%2Fpsu-psychology-data-science%2Fi9D-O5lwB6k%2Fb8aPOnUDAgAJ)
    
## How to do version control

- [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
    + free, open source version control system
    + created by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system, to manage that project's software development
- Web-based git repositories
    + [GitHub](http://github.com)
    + [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
    + [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
    
## Cons

- Designed by and for software developers
- Text files
- Wonky
- Longevity of web-based repos?
- User have to specifically push (upload), pull (download) files, merge/manage conflicts

## Pros

- Great for R code, data
- Great for Jupyter notebooks (later in course)
- GitHub exploits the power of the web
- Gilmore, Hallquist, Wyble use

## Distributed version control

<div class="centered">
<img src="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control-fig3.png" height=500px/>
</div>

## Distributed version control

- Everyone works on their own local copies
- Pull before they start work
- Save and push when they're finished

## Version control and a realistic workflow

- One size won't fit all.
- See [Seisler & Gilmore workflow](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/ss-repro-case-public/blob/master/rgilmore.md)

## Version control for RStudio Projects

- [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
- Trying it again for this course. Progress report soon.

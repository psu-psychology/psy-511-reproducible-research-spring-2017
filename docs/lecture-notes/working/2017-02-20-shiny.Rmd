## Today's topics

- Interactive data visualizations with Shiny

## What is Shiny?

- A framework for creating interactive, web-based data visualizations using R

## Examples

## Gilmore's super simple example

- Plot scatterplot of x, and y.
- $y = mx + N(0,\sigma)$, where $m$ is the slope and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the measurement error or noise.
- Vary number of points $n$, slope $m$, and error $\sigma$.
- Plot best fitting line, calculate and plot $R$ or `cor(x,y)`

## Parts of a Shiny app

- User Interface (UI)
- Server

## Sharing your Shiny app

## Why do this?

- Fun
- Informative (remember last time?)

<!-- How to handle branches and pull requests -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goal

- Use GitHub's branches feature to manage changes in a shared repository where multiple parties have write privileges.
- Use RStudio to edit a branch, commit and push it to GitHub.

## Scenario

- You're sharing a code base with a colleague and want to make an edit to one or more files
- You share edit privileges on the repo, but you don't want to ruin your colleague's hard work by making commits directly to the master branch.

## Step 1: Make your own code branch

- Go to the repo on GitHub
-

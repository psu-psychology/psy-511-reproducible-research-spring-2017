- Kingsley Schroeder
    + Kingsley is a third year student from Dayton, Ohio. She received her B.A. in Psychology from Washington & Lee University in 2014. Her research interests center on children’s gender role development, with emphases on both the acquisition of gender understanding and also the ways in which that understanding may affect children’s development. Recently, she has begun to apply these ideas to an immigrant population, specifically on the ways in which children in immigrant families balance their home and host cultures' gender traditions.
